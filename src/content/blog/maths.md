# Testing of Hypothesis

### Population -

A collection of object or individual under study having common characteristic is called population.
eg - All women in the country become population
        Thakur college becomes population

### Sample -

A sample represents a subset of population.
eg - Science department in Thakur college becomes sample.

### Parameter -

The statistical constants of a population such as mean ( μ ), standard deviation, variance, proportion(p) are called as parameters.

### Statistic -

The statistical constants of a sample such as Mean ( r̄ ), Standard deviation ( S ), Variance ( S$^2$ ) , proportion ( p ) are called as parameters.

Parameters are function of population while statistics are function of sample.

### Hypothesis -

Hypothesis is an assumption about the population parameters to be experimented.

**To types of hypothesis : -**

1. [Null hypothesis ( H$_0$ )](https://www.notion.so/Maths-3d913705035540d3ab1bd61908621ef6)
2. Alternative hypothesis ( H$_1$ )

**Null Hypothesis -**  Null hypothesis is believed to be true. A null hypothesis is an assumption statement with no effect or no difference or no change ( =, ≤, ≥ ).

**Alternative Hypothesis** - An alternative statement to null hypothesis is called as Alternative hypothesis. H$_1$ is negative of H$_0$ ( ≠, >, < ).

**Types of Errors**

|  | Reject | Accept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H_0 True | Type 1 error | No error |
| H_1 True | No error | Type 2 error  |

Type 1 error is alpha

Type 2 error is beta

**Left tailed test (Alternative Hypothesis)**
In left tail test is parameter is less than value.

**Right tailed test (Alternative Hypothesis)**
In right tail test if parameter is greater than value.
